# mcnuggies wagering protocol

This is only the smart contract.

Frontend and other stuff is in a separate repository to keep clean.

Made a solana wagering smart contract betting for fun for my Sunday 100 mcnuggets eating challenge.

This is also not a verified deployment as haven't looked much into that yet. Might need to split the repo differently to include more files so it can build correctly...

Slightly afraid of committing the program private keys
